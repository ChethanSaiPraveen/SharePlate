					<h4>Welcome to SharePlate, where our mission is to bridge the gap between excess food and those in need. We are a passionate community of individuals committed to making a positive impact on the world by reducing food waste and ensuring that no one goes hungry.</h4>

					<h3><b>Our Story</b></h3>
					SharePlate was born out of a shared concern for the alarming amount of food that goes to waste each day while many individuals and families struggle to put food on their tables. We realized that we could harness the power of technology to connect food donors with those who need it most. Our platform brings together compassionate individuals, local businesses, and organizations to create a network of food sharing and caring.

					<h3><b>Our Vision</b></h3>
					Our vision is simple but powerful: a world where every meal counts. We envision a future where no good food goes to waste, and everyone has access to nutritious meals. By using SharePlate, you become a part of this vision and contribute to building a more sustainable and compassionate society.

					<h3><b>How It Works</b></h3>
					SharePlate is a user-friendly platform that allows individuals and businesses to post surplus food and connect with those who can benefit from it. Users can easily list available food items, specify quantities, and provide pickup details. Recipients can search for nearby food donations and request what they need.

					<h3><b>Our Impact</b></h3>
					Since our inception, SharePlate has helped divert tons of food from landfills and distribute it to those facing food insecurity. We've witnessed countless stories of kindness and generosity within our community, and we're proud to have played a role in making a difference.

					<h3><b>Join Us</b></h3>
